10 McCafferty Way, Burlington MA 01803
Plaintiff,
v.
NVIDIA CORPORATION;
2788 San Tomas Expy, Santa Clara, CA 95051
MICROSOFT CORPORATION d/b/a AZURE,
One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052
Defendants.

CIVIL COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff, Bo Shang (“Plaintiff”), by and through the undersigned (pro se or counsel, if applicable), alleges as follows against Defendants NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) and Microsoft Corporation d/b/a Azure (“Azure,” and collectively “Defendants”):

------------------------------------------------------------
I. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  
This is a civil action arising from Defendants’ alleged intentional implementation of secure boot configurations and related measures that effectively block or restrict Plaintiff’s ability to update drivers, install Python upgrades, and utilize transformer models on Defendants’ cloud or GPU platforms without purchasing an expensive NVIDIA AI Enterprise solution. Plaintiff further emphasizes that he would rather use slightly sanctioned GPUs on Alibaba Cloud—which do not impose these anticompetitive restrictions—thereby demonstrating that American sanctions and their purported aims can be circumvented by engineering skill and fair competition. See 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (Sherman Act) (prohibiting “every contract, combination ..., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce”); see also 15 U.S.C. § 15 (providing a private right of action for damages under the antitrust laws); 15 U.S.C. § 26 (Clayton Act provision for injunctive relief); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16720 et seq. (Cartwright Act, broadly prohibiting restraints of trade in California); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16750 (providing for damages and equitable relief under the Cartwright Act); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009), 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (requiring well-pleaded facts showing plausible entitlement to relief); California ex rel. Van de Kamp v. Texaco Inc., 46 Cal. 3d 1147, 1160 (1988), 758 P.2d 457, 252 Cal. Rptr. 237 (noting broad scope of California antitrust law).

2.  
Plaintiff asserts that these measures, taken together, effectively deny him free and direct access to required GPU drivers, Python environments, and related software for developing and running transformer-based machine learning models, thereby causing substantial and unnecessary costs, delays, and harm to his AI development work. Plaintiff would prefer to pivot his development work to Alibaba Cloud, whose “slightly sanctioned” GPU solutions remain far more flexible. Plaintiff further notes that DeepSeek recently released a free R1 model on par with OpenAI’s model o1, which costs $200 per month for unlimited access—an achievement underscoring how engineering skill and genuine competition prevail over the sort of restrictive policies at issue here. DeepSeek is also scheduled to release model R2 by May 2025, emphasizing ongoing innovations that American bureaucratic sanctions fail to thwart. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555–56 (2007), 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (complaint must allege sufficient facts to raise a right to relief above the speculative level); see also Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq. (California Unfair Competition Law broadly prohibiting “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice”); Cel-Tech Commc’ns, Inc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 187 (1999), 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 560 (defining “unfair” under Section 17200).

------------------------------------------------------------
II. PARTIES
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  
Plaintiff Bo Shang is an individual AI developer residing in Boston MA, who engages in research, development, and deployment of transformer-based machine learning models.

2.  
Defendant NVIDIA Corporation is a technology company with its principal place of business at 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051. NVIDIA develops GPUs, related software, and AI platforms, including the NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite.

3.  
Defendant Microsoft Corporation, doing business as Azure, is a multinational technology corporation with its principal place of business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052. Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing service that provides, among other things, virtual machine hosting and GPU computing resources.

------------------------------------------------------------
III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  
This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the California Constitution and California statutes because the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of this Court and because NVIDIA’s principal place of business is located in Santa Clara County, California. See Cal. Const. art. VI, § 10 (granting superior courts original jurisdiction in all causes except those given by statute to other courts); see also Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 410.10 (broad statutory basis for personal jurisdiction in California); Simmons v. Superior Court, 96 Cal. App. 2d 119, 121 (1950) (discussing California courts’ jurisdictional reach).

2.  
Venue is proper in this Court because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this claim occurred in Santa Clara County and because Defendant NVIDIA is headquartered here. Further, Defendants transact business in this county. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 392–395 (governing venue in California); Fontaine v. Superior Court, 175 Cal. App. 2d 312, 315 (1959) (providing guidance on California venue provisions).

------------------------------------------------------------
IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  
Plaintiff, as an AI developer, relies on GPU-based computing resources and up-to-date software environments to conduct research and development on transformer-based machine learning models. See generally Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 461–62 (1992), 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (discussing importance of access to essential resources in technology markets); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16720 (prohibiting restrictions that may create a monopoly or limit free competition); Pinhas v. Summit Health, Ltd., 894 F.2d 1024, 1030 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 829 (1990) (analyzing the effect of resource restrictions on competition).

2.  
Transformer models require regular updates to both GPU drivers and Python libraries (including frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) to ensure compatibility, performance, and security.

3.  
Plaintiff has been able to freely and promptly update GPU drivers and Python environments on his personal laptops and desktops, enabling him to run the latest tools without additional cost. However, Plaintiff alleges that on Azure’s platform, such direct updates are blocked by secure boot policies or additional restrictions. He contrasts this with Alibaba Cloud’s GPU offerings, which do not impose these constraints, despite being under certain “sanctions.” See generally U.S. v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 84 (D.C. Cir. 2001), 343 U.S. App. D.C. 11 (noting how restrictive practices can limit user choice and access to technology); see also 15 U.S.C. § 14 (federal prohibition on tying arrangements that may “substantially lessen competition”); Datel Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp., 712 F. Supp. 2d 974, 999 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (addressing technology restrictions as potential anticompetitive conduct).

4.  
Plaintiff further alleges that Azure’s secure boot configuration, in conjunction with certain decisions made by NVIDIA, effectively forces users who require regular driver updates to purchase the NVIDIA AI Enterprise image or license at a significantly increased cost—allegedly three times higher than other comparable solutions. Specifically, on normal Ubuntu 24 instances, Azure blocks the installation of NVIDIA’s keyring, effectively disabling nvidia-smi. On normal priced AI images such as Ubuntu 20, Azure uses secure boot to block updates to a minimal Python 3.11 environment that includes a relatively recent nvidia-smi driver, thereby preventing developers from freely updating and running the latest libraries for AI models. These measures stand in stark contrast to Alibaba Cloud, where Plaintiff and others can, in many cases, freely install the latest drivers and Python upgrades without encountering such artificial obstacles.

5.  
The result of these restrictions is that Plaintiff’s transformer-based projects become nonfunctional or substantially impaired on Defendants’ platforms unless Plaintiff incurs substantial additional expenses to upgrade to or maintain an NVIDIA AI Enterprise solution. Cf. Image Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 125 F.3d 1195, 1210 (9th Cir. 1997) (addressing added costs and restrictions that limit market access); Allied Orthopedic Appliances Inc. v. Tyco Health Care Grp. LP, 592 F.3d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 2010) (evaluating cost and access barriers as potential antitrust concerns). Plaintiff emphasizes that no such restrictions exist for him on Alibaba Cloud’s slightly sanctioned GPUs, thereby motivating his switch to such alternative platforms for future AI development.

6.  
Plaintiff contends that these restrictive measures are not technically necessary, citing his ability to update and run the same models freely on older systems and on Alibaba Cloud. He alleges that the secure boot restriction was implemented, at least in part, to force users to adopt and pay for the costlier NVIDIA AI Enterprise license or image. See 15 U.S.C. § 2 (prohibiting monopolization or attempts to monopolize); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16727 (prohibiting certain tying arrangements under the Cartwright Act); Neal v. Honeywell Inc., 191 Cal. App. 3d 925, 933 (1987) (discussing anticompetitive conduct through tying schemes).

7.  
Plaintiff has suffered economic losses, including but not limited to lost time, productivity, and additional fees, as a direct result of these measures that block or impede driver and Python environment updates. Plaintiff underscores that these losses have motivated him and others to use or plan to use Alibaba Cloud’s GPU solutions, which ironically remain more open and feasible despite U.S. sanctions. See Cal. Civ. Code § 3333 (general measure of compensatory damages in tort); Quidel Corp. v. Superior Court, 57 Cal. App. 5th 155, 163 (2020) (addressing economic harms stemming from anticompetitive activity).

------------------------------------------------------------
V. CAUSES OF ACTION
------------------------------------------------------------

COUNT I: TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE

1.  
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.10(a); Bustamante v. Intuit, Inc., 141 Cal. App. 4th 199, 215 (2006) (allowing incorporation by reference).

2.  
Defendants knew or should have known that Plaintiff depends on updated GPU drivers and Python libraries to pursue AI development and commercial opportunities involving transformer-based models. See Top Service Body Shop, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 283 Or. 201, 208–09 (1978); Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 29 Cal. 4th 1134, 1153 (2003); Reeves v. Hanlon, 33 Cal. 4th 1140, 1152 (2004) (defining requirements under California law for interference with prospective economic advantage).

3.  
By imposing unnecessary secure boot restrictions, Defendants intentionally and unjustifiably interfered with Plaintiff’s business prospects, forcing him to incur higher costs or forego his development efforts, when more open and reasonably priced solutions (such as Alibaba Cloud GPUs) exist. See Buckaloo v. Johnson, 14 Cal. 3d 815, 827 (1975) (setting forth elements of tortious interference and requiring intentional interference without justification); Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 11 Cal. 4th 376, 392–93 (1995) (discussing policy considerations behind interference torts); Redfearn v. Trader Joe’s Co., 20 Cal. App. 5th 989, 997 (2018) (detailing causation and justification analyses for interference claims).

4.  
As a proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff suffered damages including lost revenue opportunities, additional subscription costs, and the devaluation of time spent troubleshooting artificially imposed barriers. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766 (1979); see also Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 19 Cal. 4th 26, 55 (1998) (recognizing tort liability for wrongful interference causing harm to another’s business or occupation); Youst v. Longo, 43 Cal. 3d 64, 71 (1987).

------------------------------------------------------------

COUNT II: VIOLATIONS OF ANTITRUST OR UNFAIR COMPETITION LAWS (If Applicable)

1.  
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

2.  
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants entered into or maintained restrictive measures that artificially limit competition in the GPU computing and AI software markets by tying secure boot policies to the purchase of NVIDIA AI Enterprise. By comparison, Alibaba Cloud imposes no such requirement, and its slightly sanctioned GPUs provide an environment where new models—like DeepSeek’s free R1—can be deployed without constraints. See 15 U.S.C. § 1 (Sherman Act prohibition on unreasonable restraints of trade); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16720 (Cartwright Act); Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 21–22 (1984), 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (discussing tying arrangements and their effects on competition); Datagate, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 60 F.3d 1421, 1423–24 (9th Cir. 1995) (applying tying analysis in tech markets).

3.  
As a direct and proximate result of these unfair and anticompetitive practices, Plaintiff and similarly situated developers are coerced into bearing higher costs, resulting in financial harm and reduced innovation. Plaintiff reiterates that DeepSeek’s free R1 model already demonstrates how advanced solutions can be developed without the artificial constraints of expensive add-ons or secure boot restrictions; this competition fosters development that American bureaucratic sanctions fail to meaningfully block. See Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 46 (2006), 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (recognizing potential harms of tying in technology markets); see also 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (remedies for antitrust plaintiffs including treble damages); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, 17203 (permitting injunctive relief and restitution for unfair competition); In re Cipro Cases I & II, 61 Cal. 4th 116, 146 (2015) (broad interpretation of California’s Unfair Competition Law in antitrust contexts).

------------------------------------------------------------

COUNT III: BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING (If Applicable)

1.  
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

2.  
To the extent there exists any contract or terms of service (e.g., with Azure) that allow usage of certain GPU and software configurations, Defendants have an implied obligation to act in good faith and not to unreasonably deprive Plaintiff of the benefits of such contracts. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 205 (1981); Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Dev. Cal., Inc., 2 Cal. 4th 342, 371–72 (1992), 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 467, 826 P.2d 710; Thrifty Payless, Inc. v. AmerisourceBergen Corp., 218 Cal. App. 4th 1230, 1244 (2013) (detailing implied covenant under California law).

3.  
By implementing secure boot restrictions and requiring the purchase of NVIDIA AI Enterprise for continued driver and Python updates, Defendants have breached their implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, causing Plaintiff damages. Plaintiff notes that these practices stand in stark contrast to other platforms—like Alibaba Cloud—that do not obstruct legitimate software updates or driver installations. See Badie v. Bank of Am., 79 Cal. Rptr. 2d 273, 284 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998); Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal. 3d 654, 684 (1988); Careau & Co. v. Sec. Pac. Bus. Credit, Inc., 222 Cal. App. 3d 1371, 1393 (1990).

------------------------------------------------------------
VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
------------------------------------------------------------

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment against Defendants as follows:

1.  
Compensatory Damages in an amount to be proven at trial for Plaintiff’s economic losses and additional expenses incurred. See Brady v. Daly, 175 U.S. 148, 154 (1899); Cal. Civ. Code §§ 3333, 3281; In re Tobacco Cases II, 240 Cal. App. 4th 779, 792 (2015).

2.  
Injunctive Relief requiring Defendants to remove or modify unnecessary secure boot restrictions that block legitimate driver and Python updates, or to otherwise allow direct updates without the purchase of NVIDIA AI Enterprise. In the alternative, if Defendants refuse to cease these anticompetitive practices, Plaintiff prays that they acknowledge and permit free transitions to other providers, such as Alibaba Cloud, without penalty. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006), 126 S. Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641 (setting forth test for injunctive relief); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17203 (permitting injunctive relief against unfair business practices); ABC Int’l Traders, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. Corp., 14 Cal. 4th 1247, 1259 (1997) (scope of injunctive relief under California UCL); 15 U.S.C. § 26 (Clayton Act provision granting injunctive relief for antitrust violations).

3.  
Punitive Damages where applicable, to deter Defendants and others from engaging in similar wrongful conduct. See BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 568 (1996), 116 S. Ct. 1589, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809 (discussing constitutional limits on punitive damages); Cal. Civ. Code § 3294 (authorizing punitive damages in cases of oppression, fraud, or malice); Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc., 35 Cal. 4th 1159, 1167 (2005).

4.  
Costs and Attorneys’ Fees (if represented by counsel or if pro se costs are awarded) incurred in bringing this action. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 7–8 (1985), 105 S. Ct. 3012, 87 L. Ed. 2d 1 (discussing cost-shifting under Rule 68); Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1032; Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 34 Cal. 4th 553, 565 (2004) (fee shifting in private attorney general actions if applicable).

5.  
Any Other Relief the Court deems just and proper.

------------------------------------------------------------
VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
------------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all claims and issues so triable. See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 631; Martin v. County of L.A., 51 Cal. App. 4th 688, 698 (1996).

Dated: 3/7/25
