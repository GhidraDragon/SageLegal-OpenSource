COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
MIDDLESEX, SS.
SUPERIOR COURT
-------------------------------------------------------
BO SHANG,

       Plaintiff,

v.

MIDDLESEX COUNTY DISTRICT
ATTORNEY’S OFFICE,

       Defendant.
-------------------------------------------------------

                   COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (AS ENHANCED)

       Plaintiff, Bo Shang (“Plaintiff”), brings this Complaint against Defendant Middlesex
County District Attorney’s Office (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows, incorporating
additional factual and legal authorities:

1.     Plaintiff is an individual residing in 10 McCafferty Way, Burlington MA 01803.

2.     Defendant is a public office located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

                             JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3.     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, and under
       concurrent jurisdiction principles for claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See
       Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729 (2009). This Court also has jurisdiction over claims
       arising under the Massachusetts Constitution, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act
       (MCRA), G.L. c. 12, §§ 11H & 11I, and other Massachusetts common law claims.

4.     Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the events or
       omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Middlesex County and because
       Defendant is located in Middlesex County.

                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND

5.     On or about January 8, 2025, Plaintiff alleges that the Middlesex District Attorney’s
       Office of MA, described by Plaintiff as “corrupt and despicably morally principled,”
       filed a data request to Apple, supposedly under Massachusetts Rules of Civil
       Procedure 45.

6.     This occurred on the same day Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Twitch and an AirTag +
       commerce tax (App Store) lawsuit against Apple (which hosts the Twitch app).

7.     Plaintiff asserts that this data request was not legitimately obtained under Mass. R. Civ.
       P. 45 but was instead an illegal measure taken against Plaintiff as an “enemy
       combatant,” contrary to both domestic and international law, including Geneva
       Conventions III & IV, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
       (ICCPR).

7A.    The United States is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, which set forth
       standards for treatment of persons in armed conflicts, including alleged “enemy
       combatants.” Plaintiff maintains that labeling Plaintiff as an “enemy combatant”
       without due process violates customary international humanitarian law and Supreme
       Court precedent concerning the rights of such individuals. See, e.g., Hamdi v.
       Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004); Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466 (2004); Boumediene v.
       Bush, 553 U.S. 723 (2008).

7B.    The United States is also a State Party to the ICCPR, which, under Article 9, protects
       against arbitrary arrest or detention and, under Article 14, protects due process rights.
       Plaintiff alleges that classifying Plaintiff as an “enemy combatant” in a civilian context,
       and thereby circumventing ordinary legal process, violates the ICCPR’s guarantees of
       fundamental procedural protections.

7C.    The Supreme Court has further clarified the rights of individuals designated as “enemy
       combatants” in Padilla v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 426 (2004), emphasizing the need for
       proper legal process. Plaintiff alleges these precedents reinforce the argument that
       civilian processes cannot be bypassed via “enemy combatant” designations.

7D.    In Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2 (1866), the Supreme Court held that applying
       military or martial process to civilians, when civil courts are open, is unconstitutional.
       Plaintiff contends this principle applies here, making any civilian “enemy combatant”
       label unlawful.

7E.    The Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006), further confirmed
       that efforts to circumvent civilian courts through alternative proceedings for alleged
       combatants violate U.S. constitutional principles. Plaintiff alleges that all such
       precedents collectively prohibit unilateral “enemy combatant” branding in non-war
       contexts.

8.     On January 30, 2025, Plaintiff received an email from Apple regarding this request,
       which stated in part:

       “Apple
        NOTE: THIS NOTICE IS BEING SENT FROM A NO-REPLY EMAIL ACCOUNT—ANY RESPONSE
        TO THIS EMAIL WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE

        Dear Account Holder/Customer:

        On 2025-01-08, Apple Inc. (“Apple”) received a legal request from Middlesex District
        Attorney's Office requesting information regarding your Apple account.

        Pursuant to the applicable Terms of Service and Apple’s Privacy Policy,
        http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/, and as required by U.S. law, Apple
        will be producing the requested data in a timely manner as required by the legal

        Apple Inc.”

9.     Plaintiff maintains that Defendant violated Plaintiff’s rights under federal and state law
       by improperly obtaining and misusing personal data. Plaintiff asserts a violation of
       privacy rights under G.L. c. 214, § 1B (right against unreasonable, substantial or
       serious interference with privacy), Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of
       Rights (protection against unreasonable searches and seizures), the Fourth Amendment
       to the U.S. Constitution, and international human rights norms including Article 17 of
       the ICCPR and Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).

9A.    The UDHR, though not a binding treaty, informs customary international law and reflects
       global human rights standards. Article 12 states that “[n]o one shall be subjected to
       arbitrary interference with his privacy,” a principle Plaintiff contends was violated.

9B.    The United States is also a State Party to the Convention Against Torture (CAT),
       highlighting due process norms. Plaintiff claims that Defendant’s labeling and treatment
       of Plaintiff as an “enemy combatant” violate the spirit of these international
       commitments.

9C.    In United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266 (6th Cir. 2010), the court recognized a
       reasonable expectation of privacy in certain electronic communications, requiring
       proper legal process for data access. Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s conduct flouts
       Warshak’s privacy rationale.

9D.    In Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), the Supreme Court held that obtaining
       information through technology not otherwise accessible without physical intrusion
       implicates the Fourth Amendment. Plaintiff characterizes Defendant’s subpoena or
       data request as an analogous overreach.

9E.    Under Massachusetts jurisprudence, the Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v.
       Augustine, 467 Mass. 230 (2014), recognized strong privacy protections for personal
       digital records, requiring heightened procedures for obtaining certain data. Plaintiff
       alleges that Defendant’s conduct runs afoul of Augustine’s reasoning.

10.    Plaintiff alleges that, in response to Defendant’s perceived threat, Plaintiff invoked the
       Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as recognized in District of Columbia
       v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010), and
       Caetano v. Massachusetts, 577 U.S. 411 (2016). Plaintiff also invokes Article 17 of
       the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, contending these decisions protect an
       individual right to bear “arms,” which Plaintiff interprets to include “cyber arms.”

11.    Plaintiff claims to have developed or acquired “cyber arms” by creating advanced
       persistent threats (“APTs”) and by allying with other APTs, including “Salt Typhoon.”
       Plaintiff asserts that these “cyber arms” are protected under the Second Amendment
       and Article 17 as a form of self-defense.

12.    Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s conduct in issuing or causing the issuance of a data
       request without valid legal basis constituted an unlawful intrusion upon Plaintiff’s data
       privacy, in violation of the Fourth Amendment (as incorporated by Mapp v. Ohio, 367
       U.S. 643 (1961), and recognized in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), Terry v.
       Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), Riley v.
       California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014)), Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights,
       the Stored Communications Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 2701–2712), Article 17 of the ICCPR,
       and Article 12 of the UDHR.

12A.   Plaintiff notes that third-party data requests implicate the “third-party doctrine,” as set
       forth in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979). However, Carpenter recognized
       limitations when sensitive digital data is at issue. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s
       conduct violates Carpenter’s narrowing of the third-party doctrine.

12B.   Plaintiff further cites Commonwealth v. Gouse, 461 Mass. 787 (2012), for the
       proposition that Massachusetts courts often apply heightened scrutiny to searches
       involving personal or digital privacy, reinforcing Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant’s
       subpoena was invalid or overreaching.

13.    Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s conduct effectively labeled Plaintiff an “enemy
       combatant,” heightening constitutional concerns, implicating Article 5 of the UDHR, and
       prompting Plaintiff’s reliance on the Second Amendment and Article 17 to protect
       “cyber arms” from confiscation, regulation, or direct infringement.

13A.   Plaintiff invokes Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006), to underscore the illegality
       of any extrajudicial designation of “enemy combatant” status. Plaintiff argues that
       under both domestic and international law, such designations cannot bypass civilian
       jurisdiction in ordinary contexts.

14.    Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s actions violate customary international law norms
       related to privacy, as recognized by multiple treaties and conventions to which the
       United States is a party or signatory, including the ICCPR, and contravene prohibitions
       on arbitrary interference under global human rights standards.

14A.   The United States is a signatory to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, addressing
       lawful cooperation in criminal cyber matters. Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s
       allegedly improper “cyber” classification and data request contravene the spirit of
       privacy protections contemplated by such instruments.

14B.   Although the United States has not ratified Additional Protocol I or II to the Geneva
       Conventions, Plaintiff argues that certain principles therein reflect customary
       international humanitarian law, prohibiting arbitrary or extrajudicial designations
       of civilians as combatants.

14C.   The United States is also a member of the Organization of American States and is bound
       by certain obligations under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man,
       which can inform interpretations of privacy and due process in conjunction with other
       international norms.

14D.   In addition, N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Assn. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. ___ (2022), further
       clarified the scope of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Plaintiff references
       Bruen to argue that Defendant’s attempts to limit, seize, or regulate “cyber arms”
       are inconsistent with the broad individual right recognized by the Supreme Court.

                                 CAUSES OF ACTION

                                     COUNT I
                             (Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983)

15.    Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

16.    Defendant, acting under color of state law, allegedly caused the issuance of a subpoena
       or summons without proper legal basis in violation of Plaintiff’s constitutional rights,
       including but not limited to the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable
       searches and seizures as recognized in Katz, Terry, Mapp, Carpenter, Riley, and related
       precedent.

17.    By issuing or causing this allegedly improper process, Defendant deprived Plaintiff of
       rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, in contravention of
       42 U.S.C. § 1983.

                                     COUNT II
                    (Violation of Massachusetts Civil Rights Act)

18.    Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

19.    Defendant’s conduct—issuing a data request under color of law without legitimate
       basis—constitutes interference or attempted interference with Plaintiff’s exercise or
       enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitutions and laws of the United States and
       the Commonwealth, including the right against unreasonable searches (Article 14) and
       the right to keep arms (Article 17), by means of threats, intimidation, or coercion, in
       violation of G.L. c. 12, §§ 11H & 11I. See Batchelder v. Allied Stores Int’l, Inc.,
       388 Mass. 83 (1983); Buster v. George W. Moore, Inc., 438 Mass. 635 (2003);
       Commonwealth v. Powell, 459 Mass. 572 (2011).

20.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered and will
       continue to suffer damages recoverable under the MCRA.

                                   COUNT III
                     (Abuse of Process Under Massachusetts Law)

21.    Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

22.    Under Massachusetts law, an abuse of process claim arises when legal process is used
       for an ulterior or illegitimate purpose. See Cohen v. Hurley, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 439
       (1985); Kelley v. Stop & Shop Cos., 26 Mass. App. Ct. 557 (1988); Lorusso v. Bloom,
       321 Mass. 9 (1947).

23.    Defendant allegedly misused legal process by pursuing a data request unsupported by
       valid legal grounds and did so for an improper purpose, causing harm to Plaintiff.

24.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered damages
       recoverable under Massachusetts law.

                                   COUNT IV
                    (Injunctive Relief Under Federal and State Law)

25.    Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

26.    As a result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief prohibiting
       Defendant from further unlawful use of subpoenas, summonses, or other legal process
       to access Plaintiff’s personal data without proper justification. Plaintiff seeks to enjoin
       any acts by Defendant that violate Plaintiff’s rights under federal and state law,
       including the Fourth Amendment, Article 14, G.L. c. 214, § 1B, the MCRA, the Stored
       Communications Act, and international human rights treaties such as the ICCPR.

                                  COUNT V
                    (Assertion of the Second Amendment and
              Article 17 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights)

27.    Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

28.    The Second Amendment states that “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
       shall not be infringed.” As held in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008),
       this right is individual in nature, and in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742
       (2010), it applies to the states. In Caetano v. Massachusetts, 577 U.S. 411 (2016),
       the Supreme Court reiterated its broad scope. Article 17 of the Massachusetts
       Declaration of Rights similarly protects the right to keep and bear arms. N.Y. State
       Rifle & Pistol Assn. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. ___ (2022), further refines these constitutional
       principles.

29.    Plaintiff asserts that “cyber arms” (i.e., advanced persistent threats, digital tools, or
       alliances with groups such as “Salt Typhoon”) constitute protected “arms” under the
       Second Amendment and Article 17. Plaintiff alleges that any attempt by Defendant
       to seize, regulate, or otherwise interfere with these “cyber arms” without due process
       violates Plaintiff’s federal and state constitutional rights.

30.    Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant’s labeling of Plaintiff as an “enemy combatant”
       or any related act to disarm Plaintiff’s “cyber capacity” contravenes Heller, McDonald,
       Caetano, Bruen, and Article 17 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.

31.    Plaintiff therefore seeks declaratory relief that any effort by Defendant to restrict
       Plaintiff’s possession or development of “cyber arms” violates the Second Amendment
       and Article 17, and that such restriction contravenes self-defense principles acknowledged
       by various human rights instruments, including the UN Charter’s Article 51 (albeit in
       state contexts) and related customary international law.

                              REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A.     Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all causes of action;
B.     Award Plaintiff compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages in an amount to be
       determined at trial;
C.     Grant injunctive relief restraining Defendant from seeking or using Plaintiff’s personal
       data without proper legal justification;
D.     Declare that Plaintiff’s “cyber arms” are protected under the Second Amendment and
       Article 17, and that any attempt by Defendant to restrict or confiscate them, if any,
       violates federal and state constitutions and relevant international human rights standards;
E.     Award Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988,
       G.L. c. 12, §§ 11H & 11I, or as otherwise provided by law;
F.     Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                           DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: 2/27/2025

EXHIBIT 1: On 1/30/25, the Plaintiff receives an email from Apple detailing the information request made to the Plaintiff’s developer account on 1/8/25, by the Middlsex DA’s Office. This date coincided with the Plaintiff filing 27 and 27-1 in Federal Court Case 3:24-cv-06664-JS, the first time ever anyone has won a Section 230 claim vs Twitch interactive.

EXHIBIT 2: The Plaintiff is making great progress, and expects to achieve an “Eternal” family of zero-day capabilities on the SMBv2 protocol, within a day or few days.

https://www.github.com/ghidradragon/SMBv2



EXHIBIT 3: The “Eternal” family of zero-day exploits developed by the NSA, on the SMBv1 protocol

## A Bit More Detail

1. **The Vulnerability (MS17-010)**
   - EternalBlue exploited a memory corruption bug in Microsoft’s SMBv1 server (in functions like `Srv!SrvOs2FeaListToNt` or `Srv!SrvTransaction2Dispatch`).
   - By sending specially crafted “trans2” (transaction) packets, the attacker could write arbitrary data past buffer boundaries in kernel space (in particular, in the `SRV` driver).

2. **Named Pipe vs. Trans2**
   - **Named Pipe Exploits (e.g., EternalRomance):** Some SMB exploits from the same leak abused a named pipe—often `\pipe\SRVSVC`—to hold open a file/pipe handle in the SMB server and then manipulate buffer offsets for code execution.
   - **EternalBlue’s Approach:** EternalBlue directly abused an out-of-bounds write in the SMBv1 “trans2” sub-protocol. While SMBv1 does support named pipes, EternalBlue’s trigger was not contingent on obtaining a pipe handle.

3. **Why the Confusion?**
   - All these exploits came from the same toolset (Equation Group’s FuzzBunch) and target SMB on various Windows versions.
   - EternalBlue, EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy each had different code paths and slightly different vulnerabilities, even though they were all SMB-related.

---

### Summary

- **EternalBlue** = Exploits a buffer overflow in SMBv1’s “trans2” commands.  
- **Does it use a pipe?** No—unlike some sibling exploits (e.g., EternalRomance), it does **not** hinge on a named pipe handle.
