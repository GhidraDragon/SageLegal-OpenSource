BO SHANG,
      Plaintiff,

v.

THE EDINBURGH CENTER PACT PROGRAM,
      Defendant.

________________

                                  COMPLAINT

1. PARTIES

   1.1. Plaintiff, Bo Shang, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of
        Massachusetts.

   1.2. Upon information and belief, The Edinburgh Center PACT Program is a healthcare
        provider located in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is
        subject to the laws of the Commonwealth regarding the practice of mental health
        treatment and related services. See G.L. c. 112, § 129A; G.L. c. 111, § 203; see also
        G.L. c. 123, § 1 et seq. Healthcare providers in Massachusetts, including mental
        health providers, must comply with the standards of professional conduct established
        by boards of registration and applicable statutes, and they may be held liable in tort
        if they deviate from the accepted standard of care. See Santos v. Kim, 429 Mass. 130,
        133 (1999); Kapp v. Ballantine, 380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980); Forlano v. Hughes, 393
        Mass. 502, 505–06 (1984); Felton v. Spiro, 188 Mass. 563, 567–68 (1905); Morgan
        v. Lalumiere, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 265 (1986). Under the doctrine of respondeat
        superior, a facility can be liable for the negligence of its employees acting within the
        scope of employment. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319
        n.1 (2002).

2. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

   2.1. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212,
        § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold of the Superior
        Court, and the claims arise under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
        See Maxwell v. AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., 460 Mass. 91, 99 (2011); G.L. c. 231,
        § 60B; Mello v. Stop & Shop Cos., 402 Mass. 555, 557 (1988). See also the general
        requirement that medical malpractice claims be brought in the Superior Court. Held
        v. Bail, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1989).

   2.2. Venue is proper in Middlesex County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, because the cause of
        action arose in Middlesex County and Defendant conducts business and provides
        services in Middlesex County. See Salomon S. v. C., 360 Mass. 795, 796 (1972); see
        also G.L. c. 223, § 5; Dall v. Kaylor, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (2015) (Rule 1:28
        decision).

3. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

   3.1. Plaintiff sought mental health care from Defendant beginning in or around September
        2021. See G.L. c. 123, § 1 et seq.; Toste v. Somerset County Guidance Ctr., 5 Mass.
        App. Ct. 326, 329 (1977).

   3.2. Between approximately September 2021 and December 2024, Defendant misdiagnosed
        Plaintiff as suffering from schizophrenia. This alleged diagnosis remained on
        Plaintiff’s medical records and was relied upon by Defendant’s employees and agents
        when determining courses of treatment. See Kapp v. Ballantine, 380 Mass. 186, 193,
        402 N.E.2d 463 (1980); N.L. v. Children’s Hosp. Boston, 450 Mass. 109, 114 (2007);
        Glicklich v. Spievack, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 492 (1983); Forlano v. Hughes, 393
        Mass. 502, 505–06 (1984); Morgan, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 265.

   3.3. As a result of this misdiagnosis, Plaintiff was unable to obtain the necessary and
        appropriate medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”).
        Without proper ADHD medication, Plaintiff’s ability to function as a software
        engineer was severely compromised. See Palandjian v. Foster, 446 Mass. 100, 105
        (2006); Vaidyanathan v. Days Inns of Am., Inc., 7 Mass. L. Rptr. 512, 1997 WL
        94544, at *5 (Mass. Super. Ct. 1997); Walsh v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 62 Mass.
        App. Ct. 853, 855–56 (2005); Glenn v. Aiken, 409 Mass. 699, 706 (1991) (plaintiff
        must show negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about harm).

   3.4. Plaintiff experienced extended periods of unemployment from September 2021
        through December 2024 directly attributable to the lack of proper ADHD treatment.
        He also endured pain and suffering, mental anguish, and stress due to the incorrect
        diagnosis and the failure to treat his actual condition. See Rodgers v. Boynton, 315
        Mass. 279, 280 (1943); Franklyn v. Peabody, 249 Mass. 478, 482 (1924); Conway v.
        Smerling, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 9 (1994); Goguen v. Taylor, 374 Mass. 152, 160
        (1978); Anderson v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 45 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 294 (1998)
        (mental anguish compensable in negligence).

   3.5. During this same period, Nurse Practitioner Pam Miller, employed or affiliated with
        Defendant, attempted to prescribe a game purportedly authorized by the U.S. Food
        and Drug Administration to address ADHD in children aged eight to seventeen.
        Plaintiff, then age 36, was outside the indicated age range for such therapy. See Harlow
        v. Chin, 405 Mass. 697, 702 (1989); Koch v. Kennedy, 398 Mass. 421, 426 (1986);
        Fearon v. Dermody, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 93 (2008).

   3.6. The above actions and omissions by Defendant represent a departure from accepted
        standards of mental health care, proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries, and
        contributed to his damages as more fully described below. See Brune v. Belinkoff, 354
        Mass. 102, 109 (1968); Zeller v. Cantu, 395 Mass. 76, 79 (1985); Kelly v. Rossi, 395
        Mass. 659, 662 (1985); Matsuyama v. Birnbaum, 452 Mass. 1, 17–18 (2008); Morgan,
        22 Mass. App. Ct. at 265.

4. COUNT I – MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE (MEDICAL MALPRACTICE)

   4.1. Plaintiff restates and re-alleges each and every allegation set forth above as if fully
        set forth herein.

   4.2. Under Massachusetts law, a medical provider owes a duty to exercise that degree of
        care and skill of the average qualified practitioner in the field. See Brune v. Belinkoff,
        354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968); Kapp v. Ballantine, 380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980). This
        standard of care applies equally to mental health professionals. See Zeller v. Cantu,
        395 Mass. 76, 79 (1985); Blood v. Lea, 403 Mass. 430, 434–35 (1988); Morgan,
        22 Mass. App. Ct. at 265. Liability arises when there is a deviation from this standard
        of care that proximately causes harm to the patient. See Harlow v. Chin, 405 Mass.
        697, 702 (1989); Glicklich v. Spievack, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 492 (1983); Glenn v.
        Aiken, 409 Mass. 699, 706 (1991).

   4.3. Defendant and its agents and employees owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care in
        providing accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment for his mental health
        condition(s). See Stepakoff v. Kantar, 393 Mass. 836, 841 (1985); Santos v. Kim, 429
        Mass. 130, 133 (1999); Kapp v. Ballantine, 380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980); Fearon,
        72 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 93 (2008).

   4.4. By misdiagnosing Plaintiff as schizophrenic from September 2021 through December
        2024, and by failing to prescribe or facilitate appropriate ADHD medication,
        Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff. See Brune, 354 Mass. at 109; Harlow, 405
        Mass. at 702; N.L. v. Children’s Hosp. Boston, 450 Mass. 109, 114 (2007); Forlano,
        393 Mass. at 505–06; McGuinness v. Cotter, 412 Mass. 617, 624 (1992) (breach of
        the applicable standard of care).

   4.5. The improper diagnosis and consequent failure to provide effective ADHD medication
        were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages, including unemployment
        and pain and suffering. See Mays v. Babenko, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 498 (1994);
        Doherty v. Hellman, 406 Mass. 330, 333–34 (1989); Kent v. Commonwealth, 437
        Mass. 312, 320 (2002); Glicklich, 16 Mass. App. Ct. at 492; Matsuyama, 452 Mass.
        at 25.

   4.6. As a foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff was unable to maintain
        consistent employment, leading to significant financial losses and ongoing mental and
        emotional distress. See Rodgers, 315 Mass. at 280; Conway v. Smerling, 37 Mass. App.
        Ct. 1, 9 (1994); Halley v. Birbiglia, 390 Mass. 540, 546 (1983); Goguen, 374 Mass.
        at 160; Anderson, 45 Mass. App. Ct. at 294.

   4.7. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60B, this claim is subject to a medical malpractice tribunal.
        If the tribunal finds that Plaintiff’s allegations present a legitimate question of liability,
        the matter shall proceed in this Court. See Denton v. Beth Israel Hosp., 392 Mass. 277,
        279–81 (1984); Little v. Rosenthal, 376 Mass. 573, 575–76 (1978); Faircloth v.
        DiLillo, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 928–29 (1992). The statute of limitations for
        medical malpractice in Massachusetts is generally three years from the date the
        cause of action accrues, subject to the discovery rule. See G.L. c. 260, § 4; Franklin
        v. Albert, 381 Mass. 611, 618 (1980).

5. COUNT II – NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

   5.1. Plaintiff restates and re-alleges each and every allegation set forth above as if fully
        set forth herein.

   5.2. Under Massachusetts law, a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress
        requires the plaintiff to demonstrate (a) negligence, (b) causation, (c) that emotional
        distress was foreseeable, and (d) that the emotional distress was severe. See Payton v.
        Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 557–58 (1982); Sullivan v. Boston Gas Co., 414 Mass.
        129, 132 (1993); Cohen v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 389 Mass. 327, 336 (1983).

   5.3. Defendant’s conduct in misdiagnosing Plaintiff’s mental health condition and failing
        to provide appropriate treatment fell below the standard of care, constituting
        negligence. See Brune, 354 Mass. at 109; Zeller, 395 Mass. at 79; Miles v. Edward
        O. Tabor, M.D., Inc., 387 Mass. 783, 785–86 (1982); Blood, 403 Mass. at 434–35.

   5.4. The misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment caused severe and ongoing emotional
        distress to Plaintiff, who struggled without effective treatment and experienced
        significant disruptions to his professional livelihood. See Payton, 386 Mass. at 557–58;
        Cohen, 389 Mass. at 336; O’Connor v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 401 Mass. 586, 591–92
        (1988).

   5.5. It was reasonably foreseeable that the failure to provide appropriate care and the
        continued misdiagnosis would cause severe emotional distress to an individual seeking
        competent mental health treatment. See Sullivan, 414 Mass. at 137; Aldoupolis v.
        Globe Newspaper Co., 398 Mass. 731, 737 (1986); Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389
        Mass. 47, 51 (1983); Goguen, 374 Mass. at 160.

   5.6. Plaintiff sustained severe emotional distress, including anxiety, humiliation, and
        depression, as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence. See Sullivan,
        414 Mass. at 137–38; Wyman v. Ayer Properties, LLC, 469 Mass. 64, 75 (2014);
        Rodgers, 315 Mass. at 280; Trudel v. Gagne, 328 Mass. 464, 468 (1952) (mental
        anguish as recoverable harm).

6. DAMAGES

   6.1. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:

        a. Loss of gainful employment and income from September 2021 through December
           2024;

        b. Ongoing pain and suffering, mental anguish, and emotional distress;

        c. Medical expenses related to inappropriate or ineffective treatments and any
           subsequent treatments required to address the misdiagnosis;

        d. Diminished earning capacity due to the extended disruption in Plaintiff’s career,
           given the nature of software engineering employment; and

        e. Other damages as shall be proven at trial.

7. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

   A. Enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on all counts;

   B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages, including but not limited to lost wages, lost
      earning capacity, medical expenses, and pain and suffering, in an amount to be
      determined at trial; see Kapp v. Ballantine, 380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980); G.L. c. 231,
      § 85K; G.L. c. 231, § 60H; Matsuyama, 452 Mass. at 27;

   C. Award Plaintiff interest, costs, and attorney’s fees as permitted by law; see G.L. c. 231,
      § 6B; G.L. c. 261, §§ 1 et seq.; Waldman v. American Honda Motor Co., 413 Mass.
      320, 322 (1992);

   D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

8. JURY DEMAND

   Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P.
   38(b).
