    BO SHANG,
    10 McCafferty Way
    Burlington, MA 01803

v.

Defendants:
    1. GEJING DENG
       10 McCafferty Way
       Burlington, MA 01803

    2. FU SHANG
       10 McCafferty Way

-----------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff, Bo Shang (“Plaintiff”), against Defendants,
   identified herein as Gejing Deng and Fu Shang (“Defendants”), arising out of Defendants’
   alleged false report to the Burlington Police Department on or about February 8, 2025,
   regarding Plaintiff’s pretrial release conditions. Plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief,
   including protective orders, for Defendants’ conduct pursuant to G.L. c. 231 (see, e.g., G.L.
   c. 231, § 1 et seq.), and generally recognized common law torts in Massachusetts (see Stone
   v. Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 367 Mass. 849 (1975); Ravnikar v. Bogojavlensky, 438
   Mass. 627 (2003); and related case law).

PARTIES
2. Plaintiff, Bo Shang, is an individual residing at 10 McCafferty Way, Burlington,
   Massachusetts 01803.
3. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Gejing Deng, is an individual who resides in
   Massachusetts at the same address.
4. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Fu Shang, is an individual who resides in
   Massachusetts at the same address.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the amount in controversy
   exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of this Court. See G.L. c. 212, § 3; see also G.L. c. 214
   (equitable jurisdiction) and G.L. c. 231, § 2.
6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to G.L. c. 223 because the events at issue
   occurred in Burlington, Massachusetts, which is located in Middlesex County, and because
   Defendants’ actions caused injury to Plaintiff in Middlesex County (see G.L. c. 223, § 1
   et seq.; Nixon v. Littleston, 341 Mass. 611 (1961) for venue considerations).

STATEMENT OF FACTS
7. Plaintiff was previously under certain pretrial release conditions and was no longer required to
   see a therapist, identified only as “Frank,” whom Plaintiff is suing for malpractice in the
   Middlesex Superior Court, alleging 4+ years of misdiagnosed schizophrenia resulting in
   substantial harm, including unemployment and pain and suffering (see G.L. c. 231, § 60B
   regarding medical malpractice tribunal procedures).
8. On or about February 8, 2025, Defendants called the Burlington Police Department and falsely
   informed the police that Plaintiff was in violation of a pretrial release condition by not
   attending therapy with “Frank” (see G.L. c. 268, §§ 1–6 regarding perjury and false reports;
   also see G.L. c. 269, § 13A for false reports to police in certain contexts).
9. Defendants knew or should have known that Plaintiff’s pretrial release conditions did not
   require continued therapy with “Frank,” and that calling the police based on this false claim
   would subject Plaintiff to humiliation, emotional distress, and potential adverse legal
   consequences (see G.L. c. 231, §§ 92–93 governing certain aspects of defamation and
   false statements; Noonan v. Staples, Inc., 556 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2009) discussing
   Massachusetts defamation standards; Jones v. Taibbi, 400 Mass. 786, 791–92 (1987)
   regarding falsity and harm).
10. Defendants’ false statements to law enforcement were malicious and intended to harm
    Plaintiff’s reputation, undermine Plaintiff’s ongoing malpractice lawsuit, and disrupt
    Plaintiff’s daily life (see Mass. R. Civ. P. 11(b) as to pleadings not made for improper
    purpose; see also Correllas v. Viveiros, 410 Mass. 314 (1991) regarding malicious
    prosecution/abuse of process considerations; Appleby v. Daily Hampshire Gazette, 395
    Mass. 32, 37–38 (1985) regarding defamatory intent).
11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff has suffered damages
    including, but not limited to, emotional distress, fear, reputational harm, additional legal
    expenses, and other consequential losses (see G.L. c. 231, § 6F regarding frivolous claims
    and costs; see also Draghetti v. Chmielewski, 416 Mass. 808 (1994) discussing
    defamation-related harm and proof of damages; Hazen v. Att’y Gen., 97 Mass. App. Ct.
    205, 209 (2020) regarding proof of reputational injury).

COUNT I – DEFAMATION
12. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth
    herein.
13. Defendants published false statements regarding Plaintiff’s compliance with his pretrial
    release conditions to third parties, specifically the Burlington Police Department (see Yohe
    v. Nugent, 321 F.3d 35, 40–41 (1st Cir. 2003) regarding publication to third parties; Reilly
    v. Associated Press, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 764, 770 (2003) discussing publication).
14. These statements were false and defamatory, as they portrayed Plaintiff as violating legal
    conditions when, in fact, Plaintiff was under no such obligation (see Jones v. Taibbi,
    400 Mass. 786, 790 (1987), defining defamatory statements; King v. Globe Newspaper
    Co., 400 Mass. 705, 709 (1987) discussing defamatory meaning).
15. Defendants acted negligently, recklessly, or with actual malice in making such statements.
    See Stone v. Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 367 Mass. 849, 851–52 (1975) (setting forth
    standard of fault in defamation actions); Ravnikar v. Bogojavlensky, 438 Mass. 627, 629
    (2003) (reciting elements of defamation in Massachusetts); Hazen v. Att’y Gen., 97 Mass.
    App. Ct. 205, 209 n.5 (2020) (further clarifying fault and damages); New York Times Co.
    v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) (defining actual malice in constitutional context).
16. As a direct and proximate result of these defamatory statements, Plaintiff suffered harm
    including injury to reputation, emotional distress, humiliation, and other losses. See G.L.
    c. 231, § 92 (addressing certain damages issues in defamation); Sindi v. El-Moslimany,
    896 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2018) (discussing reputational harm); Shaari v. Harvard Univ.,
    90 Mass. App. Ct. 80, 91 (2016) (regarding damages in defamation).

COUNT II – INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth
    herein.
18. Defendants’ conduct, including falsely reporting Plaintiff to law enforcement for a violation of
    nonexistent therapy requirements, was extreme and outrageous. See Agis v. Howard Johnson
    Co., 371 Mass. 140, 144–45 (1976) (defining extreme and outrageous conduct); Nancy P.
    v. D’Amato, 401 Mass. 516, 521 (1988) (recognizing severity in emotional distress claims);
    Sena v. Commonwealth, 417 Mass. 250, 263–64 (1994) (applying the standard).
19. Defendants intended to cause emotional distress or knew, or should have known, that such
    conduct would likely result in severe emotional distress to Plaintiff (see Doyle v. Hasbro,
    Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 195 (1st Cir. 1996) discussing intent and foreseeability of distress;
    Conway v. Smerling, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 8–9 (1994) regarding intent).
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff has experienced severe
    emotional distress, resulting in damages. See Wright v. Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children,
    412 Mass. 469, 473–74 (1992) (discussing severe emotional distress); Payton v. Abbott
    Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 555 (1982) (elements of emotional distress and required proof); Polay
    v. McMahon, 468 Mass. 379, 385 (2014) (addressing severity of distress).

COUNT III – ABUSE OF PROCESS (Alternatively, Malicious Prosecution)
21. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth
    herein.
22. Defendants used the legal or law enforcement process (calling the police under false pretenses)
    for an improper and malicious purpose, intending to harm or harass Plaintiff. See Fishman v.
    Brooks, 396 Mass. 643, 649–52 (1986) (examining abuse of process and malicious
    prosecution); Jones v. Brockton Pub. Mkts., Inc., 369 Mass. 387, 389 (1975) (same);
    Correllas v. Viveiros, 410 Mass. 314 (1991) (discussing misuse of legal process);
    Kelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 10–11 (1st Cir. 2002) (describing elements of abuse of process).
23. The use of such process was not justified by any legitimate cause or reason (see Kelley v.
    LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 10–11 (1st Cir. 2002) discussing improper purpose in abuse of
    process; Lorusso v. Bloom, 321 Mass. 9, 11 (1947) regarding lack of probable cause).
24. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff has incurred damages including emotional distress,
    legal fees, and other related harms. See Chervin v. Travelers Ins. Co., 448 Mass. 95, 111–12
    (2006) (noting damages available for misuse of process); Wynne v. Rosen, 391 Mass. 797
    (1984) (discussing requisite elements for malicious prosecution/abuse of process).

and grant the following relief:
